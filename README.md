##  Machine Learning course from Coursera (University of Stanford) / implementation in Python.



Coursera lecture of Andrew Ng : https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome 
```
Here you will find my implementation of the Course Machine Learning from Coursera.
I have implemented this using Python. 
All exercises represent different machine learning algorithm such as :
Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Support Vector Machines or Clustering.
